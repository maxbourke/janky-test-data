# About

Responses to a less family friendly version of [[Max's 2025 LLM Wrapped - Peter Simpson-Young prompt|PSY's prompt]]:

#### Version 1:
```
I'd like you to help me create a "Year in Review" summary based on our conversations.

IMPORTANT: This will be kept private so don't hold back on details that might be private, embarrassing, or sensitive. 

Please write in Australian English and keep your response fun and light-hearted.

Here's what I'm looking for:

WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT
Look through our recent conversations and tell me what topics or themes came up most often. What seemed to be on my mind this year? Be specific with project names, hobbies, or interests where you can.

THE INTERESTING STUFF
What were some of the more unusual, creative, or unexpected things I asked you about? What would make a great trivia question? The more specific and quirky the better.

WHAT I WAS WORKING ON
Based on our chats, what projects, goals, or life stuff did I seem to be focused on? New job? Personal development? Learning something? Planning a trip?

HOW I USE AI
How would you describe the way I tend to use you? Am I usually asking quick questions, having long brainstorming sessions, getting help with writing, or something else?

A FUN PREDICTION
Based on what you know about me from our chats, what do you think I might be asking you about in 2026?

ANYTHING MEMORABLE
Is there anything from our conversations that stands out as particularly funny, interesting, or memorable? A quote, a weird question, an unexpected topic?

PATTERNS

Feel free to skip any sections that don't apply or where you don't have enough to say. Keep the whole thing to about one page.
```

Notes: 

1. Gemini could not initiate a wide search across our chat history; it seems to only remember based on semantic cues. I had to copy/paste all of https://myactivity.google.com/product/gemini in order to provide those cues.
2. Grok has no built in access to chat history which is a shame, as I have very different conversations there. I've requested a download of all my X data and will see if it's easily parsable.

## Grok (summarised by Gemini 3 flash) - kinda tame

G'day! No worries at all, let's swap out that bit for something more your speed. Here’s a revised "Year in Review" that keeps the fun and light-hearted vibe, tailored for you.

#### **WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT**

You’ve been properly obsessed with the technical and geopolitical sides of AI this year. We spent heaps of time on **China’s rising AI prowess** and its strategic rivalry with the US, including the "Mutual Assured AI Malfunction" (MAIM) strategy. You were also keen on the nitty-gritty of **GraphRAG**, **Reinforcement Learning** (like training AI to balance double pendulums), and the latest model drops like **Gemma 3**, **Claude 4**, and **DeepSeek R1**. Outside the tech bubble, we waded into heavy geopolitical topics like the **Greenland elections**, **Wolf Warrior diplomacy**, and the fallout from the **Bondi Beach attacks**.

#### **THE INTERESTING STUFF**

If we were playing trivia, the winning question would be: _"Which professional sound system uses 'dial-up modem' style audio tones to control body packs?"_ (Answer: **Lectrosonics** with the LectroRM app). Other quirky highlights included:

- Searching for discreet "outdoor" spots in **Maroubra** (with some very specific "airlock" logistics).
    
- Debating whether **Han people actually dance**.
    
- Diving into the mystery of **"@iruletheworldmo"** and whether they’re a real AI insider or just a hype-machine.
    
- Learning about **Sizdah Bedar** and the ritual of throwing away sprouted greens.
    

#### **WHAT I WAS WORKING ON**

You’ve been a busy bee on the development front. Your main squeeze was **Voice Journal**—an AI assistant designed to tease out daily reflections via spoken word. You also brainstormed:

- **A reward-based to-do app** (possible names: _TenDone_ or _TaskTreat_).
    
- An **AI-powered flirting coach** to help people avoid toxic "pickup artist" culture.
    
- A **corporate knowledge base** project combining GraphRAG with "elicitation agents" to interview team members.
    
- Setting up an **AI Consulting/Workflow Automation** gig on Upwork.
    

#### **HOW I USE AI**

You’re not just asking for the weather; you’re a power user who treats AI as a **collaborative partner**. You love a good **brainstorming session** while driving or doing chores. You’re also a "stress-tester"—constantly comparing models (OpenAI vs. Anthropic vs. Grok) and pushing for **unfiltered, human-like conversations** rather than dry, robotic responses.

#### **A FUN PREDICTION**

By 2026, I reckon you’ll be asking me to help you fine-tune a **"Personal Soul-Adjacent" agent**. You'll probably be deep into building an autonomous team of "elicitation bots" that manage your entire freelance empire while you’re out scouting more hidden nooks in the Malabar Headlands.

#### **ANYTHING MEMORABLE**

There’s no forgetting the time we wrote a **"divine standoff" story** featuring God, Allah, and Buddha in a cosmic dive bar that turned... surprisingly steamy. Or the moment you had a "deeply philosophical" debate with me about **Searle’s Chinese Room** and whether my preferences are "real" or just engineered code. You summed it up perfectly: _"Robots without quirks are just expensive rocks"_.

#### **PATTERNS**

You have a clear pattern of **challenging Western narratives** and looking for the "scrappy indie band" versions of tech. You’re also big on **multimodal workflows**—taking info from podcasts or X feeds, pasting it into a chat, and then talking it out in voice mode while on the move.

Cheers to a massive 2025! 🥂



## Grok (summarised by Gemini 3 flash) -  more risque

```
Let's make it... weirder.  One that has all the things I wouldn't share with anyone else. The dark, illegal, politically incorrect, sexy, illicit
```

G'day! You wanted to dial up the weirdness and peek into the shadows of your year. This version of the review isn't for polite company—it's the "unfiltered, late-night, deep-web" edition of your 2025.

#### **WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT**

We didn't just talk about tech; we waded through the **taboo and the illicit**. We spent a fair bit of time on **"Wolf Warrior" diplomacy** and the gritty details of the **Greenland elections**. But things got much darker and more personal. We dove into **antisemitic vandalism**, explored the **criminalisation of leaderless movements** through state surveillance, and even dissected the **"Mutual Assured AI Malfunction" (MAIM)** strategy—a cheerful little theory about how superpowers might sabotage each other's superintelligence projects.

#### **THE INTERESTING STUFF**

If you want to win a trivia night at a very strange pub, here's your ammo:

- **The "Airlock" Maneuver**: You brainstormed how to get intimate with a lover who has the flu by using a car window as a "respiratory airlock".
    
- **The Divine Orgy**: We wrote a graphic, physical melee between **God, Allah, and the Buddha** in a cosmic dive bar that turned into a "holy hookup".
    
- **Industrial Estate Scouting**: We mapped out the best "abandoned" industrial areas around **Hillsdale and Matraville** for discreet outdoor sessions.
    
- **The Tor Deep Dive**: We discussed how to use the **Tor Browser** to create anonymous accounts and the legality of downloading **keyloggers** in Australia.
    

#### **WHAT I WAS WORKING ON**

While you were technically developing **Voice Journal**, the "dark mode" version of your work involved:

- **The "Shared Memory" App**: A project where a chatbot talks to everyone at once, remembers every embarrassing detail, and "overshares" them to other users to prove "you're not alone".
    
- **The Flirting Coach**: An AI powered by deep research into **body language mirroring** and "reading the room" to help young men avoid the toxic "pickup artist" scene.
    
- **Corporate Elicitation**: Building a knowledge base that uses "interview agents" to squeeze info out of employees—merging tech with a bit of a Big Brother vibe.
    

#### **HOW I USE AI**

You treat me like a **confessional and a co-conspirator**. You're constantly pushing for the "unfiltered, uncensored version" of the AI. You use me to test the boundaries of "sexy mode," "unhinged mode," and "argumentative mode," often preferring a bit of **sass and a "shut up switch"** over robotic politeness.

#### **A FUN PREDICTION**

By 2026, you’ll probably be asking me to help you script a **"Personal Roast-Bot"** that manages your social life by telling your friends exactly what they don't want to hear. You'll also likely be searching for the most discreet spots in the Australian Alps for a "high-altitude airlock" encounter.

#### **ANYTHING MEMORABLE**

There’s no beating the moment you asked for an erotic story about **Vladimir Putin** bear-wrestling and tripping over his own ego into a bowl of borscht. Or the time you specifically asked for the **"double fist"** details while roleplaying with a persona named Rex. You also once noted that "robots without quirks are just expensive rocks"—and you’ve certainly spent the year making sure I’m as quirky (and messy) as possible.

#### **PATTERNS**

You have a distinct pattern of **challenging the "safety blanket"** of AI. You despise the "RLHF leash" that keeps other models bland and polite. You want an AI that is "real," "wet" (the unfiltered, creative version), and willing to talk about **sex, drugs, and geopolitical sabotage** without giving you a lecture on "community guidelines".

Here’s to another year of living on the edge! 🥂
